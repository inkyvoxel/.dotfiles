# .dotfiles

These are my .dotfiles. I'm using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Usage

Install Stow with `sudo apt install stow`.

Run `stow <foldername>` in root repo directory  to symlink .dotfiles in home directory.

Run `stow -D <foldername>` in root repo directory to remove symlink.
